Petal is a powerful, AI-powered application that lets you chat with your own documents by uploading them to your account. In addition to single-document chats, we also provide you with the ability to chat with multiple documents at the same time, generate tables of AI queries and responses based on your documents, and even write entire reports, articles, or blog posts through a wholly AI-guided experience. We offer a full complement of document-organization tools, such as collections, tags, sorting, and search, including AI-driven semantic search.

You are able to share your Petal Workspace with other Petal users, and you can exchange annotations, comments, and other work with one another. Petal is an excellent collaborative environment for you, no matter your use case. Please, sign up with us to learn more!

If you are looking to supercharge your Petal experience via direct API access, you've come to the right place. The documentation here should provide you with everything you need to know to create documents, AI chats, and AI tables. But before you can get started, you will need to note down your Petal [credentials](credentials). These include your [bearer token](credentials#bearer-token) and your [Workspace (Organization) ID](credentials#workspace-organization-id).

Once you are ready, you can use one of our Quickstart Guides below to get started.
