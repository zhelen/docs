## Prerequisites

Before you can create a chat Session, you will need:
1. Your bearer token, user ID, and desired Workspace ID. They can be obtained as described [here](/intro/credentials).
2. Software that can use APIs, such as cURL or Python.
3. At least one Document in your Workspace.

## Create an AI chat Session

Before you can start creating chat messages, you must create an AI chat Session. The API endpoint for creating a Session is `https://cite.petal.org/api/ai/session/create`. You will need to send a POST request to the endpoint, with the following parameters:

<ParamField path="organization_id" type="integer">
  The ID of your Workspace/Organization
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="user_id" type="integer">
  Your personal user ID
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="document_ids" type="array">
  The list of IDs for the Documents you wish to include in this chat
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="is_multidoc" type="boolean">
  Whether you want to use multi-doc chat (Available to users of Petal Advanced Plan and above). Multi-doc chat uses a higher context size compared to single-doc chat. It is possible to have a multi-doc Session with only one Document in `document_ids`, but it is not possible to have a single-doc Session with more than one Document
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="visibility" type="string">
  Can be `private` or `shared`. Determines whether other users in the Workspace can see this Session
</ParamField>

Below is an example of such a request.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --location --request POST 'https://cite.petal.org/api/ai/session/create' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{   
    "organization_id": 1,
    "user_id": 1,
    "visibility": "private",
    "is_multidoc": true,
    "document_ids":[1,2,3]
}'
```

```python Python
import requests
import json

url = "https://cite.petal.org/api/ai/session/create"

payload = json.dumps({
  "organization_id": 1,
  "user_id": 1,
  "visibility": "private",
  "is_multidoc": True,
  "document_ids": [
    1,2,3
  ]
})
headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)

print(response.text)
```

```java JavaScript
var settings = {
  "url": "https://cite.petal.org/api/ai/session/create",
  "method": "POST",
  "timeout": 0,
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <token>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "data": JSON.stringify({
    "organization_id": 1,
    "user_id": 1,
    "visibility": "private",
    "is_multidoc": true,
    "document_ids": [
      1,2,3
    ]
  }),
};

$.ajax(settings).done(function (response) {
  console.log(response);
});
```

</CodeGroup>

This request, if successful, should return a JSON object, indicating that your Session has been created. In particular, you will want to note down the `id` returned, as that is the unique Session ID that you will need to create messages within it. Once you have located it, we can move on to message creation.

## Create chat messages in your Session

All chat messages are located within a given Session. This allows the AI (and you) to keep track of the flow of a conversation. Once you know the Session ID in which you wish to create a message, make a POST request to `https://cite.petal.org/api/ai/session/<id>/qa/create`. You need to enter the Session ID into the URI (at `<id>`), and the body of the request should contain your message to the AI:

<ParamField path="query" type="string">
  Your message here.
</ParamField>

Sample code is provided below.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --location --request POST 'https://cite.petal.org/api/ai/session/<id>/qa/create' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "query": "What is a LLM?"
}'
```

```python Python
import requests
import json

url = "https://cite.petal.org/api/ai/session/<id>/qa/create"

payload = json.dumps({
  "query": "What is a LLM?"
})
headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)

print(response.text)
```

```java JavaScript
var settings = {
  "url": "https://cite.petal.org/api/ai/session/<id>/qa/create",
  "method": "POST",
  "timeout": 0,
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <token>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "data": JSON.stringify({
    "query": "What is a LLM?"
  }),
};

$.ajax(settings).done(function (response) {
  console.log(response);
});
```

</CodeGroup>

If successful, the API should return a JSON object with information about the new chat message. In particular, you will want to pay attention to these two fields:

<ResponseField name="id" type="integer" required>
  A unique ID for this chat message. 
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="task_status" type="string" required>
  The progress of getting the AI to respond to your message. It should change from `pending` to `running` to `success` over time.
</ResponseField>

In the beginning, all message `task_status` should be `pending`. This is because it takes some time to submit the user message to the AI and get a response. In order to fetch updates to the message, you should use the API `https://cite.petal.org/api/ai/session/<id>/qa/list`, which will return a list that contains all chat messages for the given Session. 

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --location --request GET 'https://cite.petal.org/api/ai/session/<id>/qa/list' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--data-raw ''
```

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://cite.petal.org/api/ai/session/<id>/qa/list"

payload = ""
headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>'
}

response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers, data=payload)

print(response.text)
```

```java JavaScript
var settings = {
  "url": "https://cite.petal.org/api/ai/session/<id>/qa/list",
  "method": "GET",
  "timeout": 0,
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"
  },
};

$.ajax(settings).done(function (response) {
  console.log(response);
});
```

</CodeGroup>

For every chat message, the AI's response is given by the `response` field in the JSON. While the `task_status` of that message is `running`, the response may be incomplete because the AI is still working. Once the `task_status` is `success`, the response will be complete.
