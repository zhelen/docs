Here you will find descriptions of our APIs for interacting with documents, AI Chats, and AI Tables. If you have need of other APIs that would allow you to better interface with our app, please [let us know](mailto:help@petal.org)!

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using bearer tokens. In addition, you will need your Organization ID to specify which Workspace (Organization) you wish to work with. Sometimes, you will also need your unique User ID. To understand how to obtain these pieces of identifying information, please see [this guide](/intro/credentials).

For certain APIs, you must be a member or admin of the Workspace before you can use them. If you encounter such an issue, please speak with your Workspace admins to resolve it.
